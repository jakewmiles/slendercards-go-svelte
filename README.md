## Introduction
slendercards is a web app built to help people learn foreign languages. Users can choose from multiple language pairs and automatically generate context-based flashcards based on personal search terms.

slendercards-go-svelte is a front-end application, built using Svelte. To function correctly it must make calls to a server/database. Currently, the main server runs on Go (Golang), see [slendercards-go-server](https://github.com/jakewmiles/slendercards-go-server)
